# External Agent Builder

This repository includes a skill that guides you through building standalone external agent binaries for the [Entire CLI](https://github.com/entireio/cli). The current testing split is:

- Protocol compliance in `external-agents-tests`
- Lifecycle integration in this repo's `e2e/` harness
- Agent-specific unit tests in each `agents/entire-agent-*` module

## Available Commands

| Command | Skill file | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Full pipeline | `.claude/skills/entire-external-agent/SKILL.md` | Run all three phases sequentially |
| Research | `.claude/skills/entire-external-agent/research.md` | Analyze the target agent's capabilities and map to the protocol |
| Write tests | `.claude/skills/entire-external-agent/write-tests.md` | Scaffold the binary and wire protocol compliance plus lifecycle coverage |
| Implement | `.claude/skills/entire-external-agent/implement.md` | Build the binary using protocol compliance first, lifecycle second, unit tests last |

## How to Use

When the user asks to "build an external agent", "create an agent binary", or "external agent plugin":

1. Read `.claude/skills/entire-external-agent/SKILL.md` for the full pipeline overview
2. Follow the three phases in order: research, write-tests, implement
3. Each phase has a dedicated skill file with detailed instructions
4. Keep reusable protocol checks out of this repo's `e2e/` directory. Add them to `external-agents-tests` instead.

## Tool Mapping (Codex)

The skill files reference Claude Code tool names. Map them to Codex equivalents:

| Skill references | Codex equivalent |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| `TodoWrite` | `update_plan` |
| `Task` / subagent launches | Codex's native subagent system |
| `Skill` tool | Read the skill file directly |
| `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Bash` | Native Codex tools |

## Protocol Spec

The external agent protocol is defined at:
